# tech-ed-week-3-assignment

This is my week03 assignment, which is to build a cookie clicker game.

# Description

This is a cookie clicker game that is suitable for both desktops and tablets. The game consists of a cookie that can be clicked to earn more cookies, as well as a cookie shop that adds to the cookies per second counter. Both the cookies and cookies per second counter are displayed. The game is equipped with sound effects and music that can be turned on/off through the menu button, you will also find a game reset button here.
If unsure on how to play the game there is a how to play button, that will havbe further information.

# How To Get The Game

You can get this game by downloading this git repository that is attached to this. You could also just play this game by clicking on the deployment link.

# Acknowledgment

I would have been able to make such an amazing game without the inspiration of many other coders. The following links direct to websites I have used to create the menu and how to play modal, the on/off toggle switch for the music and the cookie upgrade API used:
