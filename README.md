This is my week 03 assignment, which is to build a cookie-clicker game.

# Description

This is a cookie clicker game suitable for desktops and tablets. The game consists of a cookie that can be clicked to earn more cookies and a cookie shop that adds to the cookies per second counter. Both the cookies and cookies per second counter are displayed. The game is equipped with sound effects and music that can be turned on/off through the menu button. You will also find a game reset button here.
If unsure of how to play the game there is a how-to-play button, that will have further information.

# How To Get The Game

You can download the game from the git repository attached to this. You can also play it by clicking on the deployment link.

# Assignment Reflection

Starting this project I aimed to complete all the requirements set, which I believe I have done besides providing a clear README file. This is something that I believe I can work on when it comes to future projects, and I do feel like my current attempt at it was not too bad. I was also unable to reach the goal of implementing error handling using try/catch as I got distracted troubleshooting my code. I wouldn't say that I found this assignment difficult, but I would say that I found it quite time-consuming. However, this may be due to my need to achieve perfection. I would say that I felt like I was overcomplicating the CSS code and that I could have written it nicer.

# Acknowledgment

I would not have been able to make such an amazing game without the inspiration of many other coders. The following links direct to websites I have used to create the menu and how to play modal, the on/off toggle switch for the music and the cookie upgrade API used:
